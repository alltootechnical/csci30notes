# CSCI 30/CS 110 Lecture Notes
This is a repository for my lecture notes on CSCI 30/CS 110 (Data Structures and Algorithms), as currently being taught in First Semester, SY 2019--2020.

## How to compile
You will need the following:
 - [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (or any LaTeX distribution)
 - [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) (`pip install Pygments`)
 - make (from the `build-essential` package)
 - The fonts folder (you can get it [here](http://penoy.admu.edu.ph/~guadalupe154884/files/_fonts.zip))

Then compile the document by running `make`.
