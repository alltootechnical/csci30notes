    The body text is set in Whitney, a humanist sans-serif typeface designed in 2004 by Tobias Frere-Jones of Hoefler \& Frere-Jones (now known as Hoefler \& Co.). Originally developed as an institutional typeface for New York's Whitney Museum, Whitney aims to be functional for signage as well as editorial usage by bridging the gap between gothics such as Franklin Gothic and humanists such as Frutiger.
    
    \medskip
    Code listings and snippets are set in Operator, designed by Hoefler \& Co. in 2016. A typeface rooted in the traditions of typewriting, Operator builds on the aesthetic of typewriting, but sheds these mechanical constraints.
